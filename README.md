# A simple Q&A made with state machines and CSS animations

The above game is an engaging and interactive web-based experience that combines a question-and-answer format with captivating 3D animation. Players are presented with a virtual cube, each face of which reveals a question or answer related to a specific topic. As they progress through the game, they're tasked with answering the questions using a provided input field. The game employs a fuzzy comparison algorithm to evaluate the accuracy of user responses, allowing for flexibility in spelling and minor errors. 

The game leverages a state machine to provide a dynamic user experience. It transitions between states such as "initial," "correctAnswer," "wrongAnswer," and "jumpUp." Correct answers result in the cube gracefully rotating to unveil the next question, while incorrect answers trigger a different animation. Additionally, once all questions are answered correctly, the cube performs a celebratory jump. With its combination of 3D visuals, interactive gameplay, and a challenging yet forgiving response system, this game offers an enjoyable way to test and expand one's knowledge on a variety of topics.
